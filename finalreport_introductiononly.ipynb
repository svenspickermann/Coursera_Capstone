    "For electrical cars to be a viable alternative to conventional cars, there is a need for a widespread infrastructure in the form of charging stations as well. The aim of this project is to take a closer look at the city of DÃ¼sseldorf in Germany and to determine -for a hypothetical provider of charging stations- where would be the best district to place one. In order to achieve this, I will first analyze the existing network of charging stations in the city and then determine gaps in this network with a possible demand.\n"
